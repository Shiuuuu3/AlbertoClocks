        <p>Apple not only succeeds with great iPhones, but also creates smart products that people love and constantly
            seek, including the Apple Watch. If you are planning to buy one but don't know what function apple watch
            has? Huy Phong will introduce you to its 9 outstanding features that are guaranteed to make you excited and
            want to own a trendy Apple watch product from this Apple family.</p><br>

        <h3>1. Apple Watch Series 8</h3>
        <p><img src="/img/hinh-dang-apple-watch-series-8-45mm-gps-vien-thep-day-thep-didongviet.webp"
                alt="Apple watch series 8"></p>
        <p>The Apple Watch 8 is the best Apple Watch yet. It’s not a major upgrade over the Apple Watch Series 7 in
            terms of features, but it has the same great design and larger screen. What's new between the Apple Watch
            Series 8 vs. Series 7 is the skin temperature sensor, which can inform cycle and fertility tracking, as well
            as sleep tracking. The Series 8 also launched with the long-awaited low power mode, which can extend the
            latest Apple Watch's battery life to 36 hours. What's more, the Apple Watch 8 has a new crash detection
            feature, leveraging improved motion sensors for instant help when you might need it most. <br><br>

            Otherwise, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a full-featured health tracker and communications tool. With watchOS
            9, this smartwatch packs the latest and greatest of what the Apple Watch experience has to offer. Whether
            you want a smartwatch for working out, answering calls from your wrist, or using the best Apple Watch apps,
            this is the smartwatch for you.</p><br>

        <h3>2. Apple Watch SE (2022)</h3>
        <p><img src="/img/9QaTT2ivhEqBW2rqfodL9E-1200-80.jpg.webp" alt="Apple Watch SE"></p>
        <p>The Apple Watch SE is kind of a hybrid device, pairing an older Apple Watch design with the Apple Watch
            Series 8's chipset. The $249 (AU$399) smartwatch doesn't have all the Series 8's features, but still stands
            out for its great fitness tracking and safety features. It also offers an LTE option, making it a good
            choice for those interested in trying out Family Setup. <br><br>

            When choosing between the Series 8 and SE your ultimate decision will be if you want to spend an extra $150
            (AU$230) for a brighter display with an always-on option, an ECG monitor and skin-temperature, and a bigger
            display. If those tools aren't deal-breakers for you, the SE is a highly capable option for iPhone users. It
            even gets watchOS 9, the most up-to-date Apple Watch software with low power mode, fresh new watch faces, an
            upgraded workout interface, a redesigned compass tool and the new Medications app.</p><br>

        <h3>3. Apple Watch Ultra</h3>
        <p><img src="/img/apple-watch-series-tgdd-1-23-1_1280x720-800-resize.jpeg" alt="Apple Watch Ultra"></p>
        <p>The Apple Watch Ultra is the best Apple Watch to buy if you're a serious athlete. In addition to new watchOS
            running features, the Ultra has an extra third button — the Action Button, which makes pausing the watch, or
            lapping the watch on the move, that little bit easier with sweaty fingers, or when wearing gloves. <br><br>

            Its 49mm screen is huge, especially on petite wrists, but it's built for adventure. The bezel is made from
            titanium, with a lip around the screen to add more protection. The display is made from sapphire glass, and
            the watch has an increased water resistance of 100m. With up to 60 hours of battery life (in low power
            mode), it also has the stamina to keep up. <br><br>

            The Apple Watch Ultra is a serious smartwatch. It's not for everyone, but at the time it's the Apple Watch
            some people might've been waiting for. </p><br>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>1.How to choose the best Apple Watch for you?</h3>
        <p>Choosing the best Apple Watch for you doesn’t need to be a hard decision. In most cases, it will come down to the newest Apple Watch 8 vs. Apple Watch SE (2022). We’d recommend getting the Series 8 if you have the $399 (AU$629) to spend for its bigger display. The Apple Watch SE might be a better option for first-time users, though. <br><br>

            No matter which you choose, you’ll benefit from the watchOS 9 software update, meaning all three watches will have several features in common. Just be sure to review our Apple Watch guide so you know how to make the most of your smartwatch. <br><br>
            
            Also, check out our Apple Watch Series 7 vs. Series 6 and Apple Watch Series 6 vs. Series 5 face-offs to see if a refurbished version of the discontinued model makes the most sense for you. <br><br>
            
            And, if you’re still questioning which Apple Watch is best, or whether the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for you, take a look at our smartwatch buying guide. It includes our face-offs, which may help you determine whether a fitness tracker from Fitbit better suits your needs. <br><br>

        <h3>2.Should you get an Apple Watch with LTE?</h3>
        <p>Select models of the Apple Watch Series 7 and Apple Watch SE (2022) support LTE service. LTE-capable models come at a $50 (AU$80) or $100 premium. The Apple Watch Ultra comes with LTE by default. <br><br>

        It’s important to know that the cost of liberating your Apple Watch from your iPhone won’t end there. You’ll need to pay a monthly fee to your cellular provider to support your watch’s phone-free features.</p><br>
        <p><img src="/img/P3Qh4SsT53x7WgPRe68FdE-1200-80.jpg.webp" alt=""></p>
        <p>We still bring our iPhones everywhere, so we haven’t felt like LTE is a must for Apple Watch users yet. That said, as the Apple Watch becomes more autonomous, there could be more scenarios in which leaving your phone behind makes sense. There’s a safety benefit to having LTE, too — if your phone dies or gets lost, your Apple Watch is able to keep you in touch. It's also helpful if you know how to use Apple Pay on Apple Watch.</p>
